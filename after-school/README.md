# After School
## Overview
Authenticity Meets Positivity. On After School, students can share openly and honestly, without fearing judgment or ridicule. They choose whether to reveal their name or remain private.
After School's innovative features channel students toward making new connections and friendships, and engaging in positive offline activities.
The messages students share are overwhelmingly positive: compliments, notes of encouragement and support, and ideas for fun in-person activities.
