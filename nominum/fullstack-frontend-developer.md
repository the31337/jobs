## Quick Summary
Our company’s software provides Internet access and applications for the largest, most diverse Internet service providers around the world, providing products that range from internet connectivity to providing innovative security solutions and messaging that reaches more than 500 million consumers each day, and that number is growing.

Our platform provides internet connectivity for all subscribers; we protect subscribers from botnets; networks from DNS DDOS attacks; our Engage applications provide subscriber safety from phishing and malware downloads as well as the ability to mediate Internet access controlled by subscribers, and we’re hiring. We have very ambitious (maybe a little crazy) goals, so there will be plenty of opportunities to tackle stimulating technical problems using the most cutting edge technologies available. If you’re interested in consumer facing web applications that reach millions of subscribers, data visualization, big data analytics, complex rules engines, or building the distributed systems scale to support all of this for our subscriber base, we should talk. As we grow, we’re being very careful not to lose our culture. If you want to work in a collegial environment where you can be a part of a small, dynamic engineering team and where you can really take ownership of a project, you’ll probably fit in just fine. At our company, attitudes are forbidden, and ideas are championed.

We have great customers and reach, so the company has huge opportunities, but we’ve been able to avoid the endless meetings and bureaucratic hoops that large companies have just to get simple things done. And we have all the good parts of a small start-up with a product that is growing fast, needs scale, and innovative new features.  At our company, things move fast. We have to be agile and responsive without losing sight of the bigger picture.
