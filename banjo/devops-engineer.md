## Devops Engineer
#### Redwood City, Ca

### Quick Summary
We’re a rapidly growing team of big thinkers and big doers. We don’t just talk about things, we make them happen – in record time. We’re looking for people with passion, a point of view, and a go-getter mentality to become a part of the amazing work we are doing here at Banjo. Our team is motivated by challenges and dreams big. If that sounds like you, Banjo might just be the perfect fit. And if you’re a crack shot with a Nerf gun, or know how to duck and cover, even better.

### Job Description
We are solving one of the largest real-time data problems today. We move at an extraordinary pace, with our data and as a start-up. Our real-time data pipeline processes quadrillions of calculations per minute and that number is growing rapidly. We have one of the largest MongoDB installations in the world and our customers expect “5-nines” availability

We are looking for an engineer with strong technical skills to be a key member of our expanding DevOps team. You will help architect the strategies within DevOps that will ensure we are running at optimal efficiency. We take uptime quite seriously and we expect you do too. You design with redundancy in mind yet you hate repeating yourself so you understand the need to automate. Ruthlessly. Obsessively.

### What you'll do
+ You have 3+ years experience in a DevOps role
+ You know your way around scripting languages(e.g. Python, Ruby, Shell) and automation tools (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc)
+ You have extreme attention to detail, in fact we hope you are obsessive with the details.
+ You have experience with MongoDB or other NoSQL database in a DevOps or engineering capacity.
+ Experience with Elasticsearch, Redis-Sentinel, RabbitMQ is a plus.
+ This is the one role where we want someone’s head to be in the clouds. We hope you eat, sleep, breathe and dream large scale AWS installations.
+ We use many systems to help us scale. Ideally, you have experience with technologies like elasticsearch, redis, and rabbitmq to name a few.
+ You are comfortable working in an agile environment.
