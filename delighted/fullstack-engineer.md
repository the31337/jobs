## Fullstack Engineer
#### Palo Alto, CA

### Quick Summary
We are a small design-driven team, focused on impeccable user experience. Simplicity, quality, and care inform our decisions and processes. We believe in a collaborative, feedback-rich design process, and feel that great experiences can only come from teams who care deeply. This is the company we’ve always wanted to exist.

### Job Description
You’re a product-obsessed software engineer who evaluates all of your work through the lens of user experience, regardless of which layer of the stack you’re working in. You’ve created a number of fully-formed software products that have been released into the wild. You believe that code is a means to an end, not the end itself.
Because the range of projects is diverse, we need a full-stack Rails engineer with experience working on a wide variety of products. You’ll work on projects like: improving our natural language date range search, implementing integrations with 3rd party services, or working to improve the responsiveness and reliability of our API. You’ll also work with the entire team in creating new customer-facing features, from idea, through prototype, to release and maintenance.

### Qualifications
+	Our backend runs on Rails with MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch on AWS. You should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with Rails.
+	Our front-end is built with CoffeeScript, SASS and HAML. You should have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
+	The glue between our front-end and back-end is HTTP, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.
+	We write automated tests for all of our code. You should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.
