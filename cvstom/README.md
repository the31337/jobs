# Cvstom

## Overview
Currently in stealth mode and for good reason; They're creating a major competitive product to a name brand medical device.
This full-stack vertically integrated healthcare service (FDA approved) is a tele-medecine and device solution which is already revenue generating.
With a signed NDA to begin an interview, they'll happily tell in plain English what they do in fine detail; until they launch (very soon) that will remain undisclosed

This is a modern, frictionless healthcare experience powering choice with software. They provide their patients with an FDA approved medical device and accompanying software for patients and they're backed by top-tier funds on a mission to improve healthcare delivery.
