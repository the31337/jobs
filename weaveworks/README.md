# Weaveworks
## Overview
The Weaveworks philosophy is to enable developers to focus all of their energies on the application itself. Meanwhile Weave takes care of connecting the containerized application components – wherever they may be. Weave observes components and their interactions to provide visibility and insights; and Weave provides runtime control over the resulting system.

In all the excitement around containers, it’s easy to forget that all of this infrastructure is in service of applications. A realistic application will have multiple components packaged across multiple containers, with multiple instances of those components deployed across multiple machines. That’s a lot of multiplication, and in a fast-moving environment it can quickly become hard to manage and keep track of everything. How do component instances find each other? How does network traffic get routed between containers? How does a DevOps team understand all of the application interactions that are happening?

Weave stands the traditional infrastructure-centric model on its head. Instead of provisioning infrastructure and then fitting your applications to it, Weave starts with your application and moulds the necessary infrastructure around it. It’s non-intrusive and it’s a much better fit with modern DevOps approaches. And of course all of this is done transparently, dynamically, and resiliently.
