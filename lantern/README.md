# Lantern
## Overview
Finding emotional well-being during life’s twists and turns isn’t easy. Accessing care is at best expensive, and at worst completely out of reach. And that’s where Lantern comes in. Founded in 2012 in San Francisco, we’re a team of researchers, technologists, and clinicians translating clinical research and expertise into simple, effective web and mobile programs based in cognitive behavioral therapy.

We’re not about unrealistic promises or get-happy-quick schemes. We’re about removing the stigma and barriers that prevent people from strengthening their emotional selves, offering a holistic approach to making every day better.

We envision a world in which people think differently about their mental health–where they feel empowered to take a simple step toward self-improvement. We’re on a mission to make this happen, and we hope you’ll join us.
