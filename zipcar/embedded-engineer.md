# Embedded Engineer
### San Mateo, CA

## Responsibilities
+ You will be responsible for developing, testing and supporting the firmware that is deployed in tens of thousands of cars, across the world.
+ You will also be responsible for supporting new prototypes, suggest, design and create proof of concepts for new features; as well as be proactive with improving the current firmware.
+ You will need to interact with both the electrical engineers and the software team and act as interface between the hardware and the backend’s features.

## Requirements
+ You are an expert in pure C and have a strong background of developing and debugging Microchip PIC microcontrollers.
+ You’re capable of building your own tools to facilitate development, debugging, and support.
+ You can debug SPI, I2C, UART and other protocols just by looking at the oscilloscope.
+ You are confident that your code will not crash someone’s car on the other side of the country.
You will go the extra mile to save a few milliwatts.
+ You smile and thank the electrical engineer when he changed all the pin allocations, again.
+ Your first temptation is not to buy an off the shelf library.

## Bonus points
+ You have a good knowledge of ARM architectures.
+ You have been responsible for FOTA deployments and associated monitoring.
+ You know what the result of the request mode 1 of the PID 1 is.
+ You successfully implemented Bluetooth protocols.
+ You know your way around a soldering iron and the oscilloscopes, because you never know when the electrical engineers will be out.

## Challenge
You are given a board with a PIC24EP512GU and a BlueNRG-MS chip from STMicro. Write the PIC firmware to make the board discoverable.

Document all assumptions that you take.
