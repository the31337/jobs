# Momentum Machines
## Overview
Mixing technology with food, but what makes them unique is that they're starting from right inside the kitchen. Their first product is a fully autonomous burger-crafting robot, meaning this robot can go from chopping and assembling the ingredients all the way to grilling the patty and toasting the buns. They've got a brilliant team with backgrounds in robotics coming from Berkeley, Stanford, Tesla, and NASA. They will be opening up a fully automated restaurant with these bots that make up to 400 burgers/hour.

Founded in 2009 and located in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood, Momentum Machines is a small collective of food lovers and engineers with decades of robotics and restaurant experience. In the past five-plus years, we’ve solved many difficult engineering and manufacturing challenges, helped each other grow, and built some interesting intellectual property.

Our first device makes gourmet burgers from scratch. Not only do we grind the meat to order, we also slice tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a brioche roll fresh for you. Accented by an infinitely personalizable variety of produce, seasonings, and sauces, you can get exactly what you’re craving.

Serving a burger this great at such affordable prices would be impossible without culinary automation. We’re building an engineering-focused group of analytic and creative individuals. The team consists of roboticists from institutions including Berkeley and Stanford and firms like Tesla and NASA. Our culinary team contains veterans of  Chez Panisse and Fat Duck. Our advisors include experts across fields like engineering, culinary, design, intellectual property, and even a NRN Restaurant Operator of the Year Award winner. Additionally, we’re further advised and supported by some of the top investors in the Silicon Valley.
