## Delivery Engineer (DevOps)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We connect you to local farmers and food-makers, making buying and enjoying the freshest local food easier than going to the store. Our mission is to develop a way to help grow local businesses who enrich their communities, grow food using sustainable practices, treat employees fairly, and make their food with care.

### Job Description
The Delivery Engineering team supports the culture of DevOps here. We build shared tools and services that enable every team to deploy, monitor, and maintain their own production environments. The work we do helps our peers move faster, deliver more, and break less. We're full stack developers with a soft spot for operations, automation, and the libraries that help us build applications.

We'll soon be starting a project to build out our own Platform as a Service (PaaS).  This work will be heavily based on existing container-centric OSS like CoreOS, Kubernetes, OpenShift and/or Docker.  The platform will initially support our growing ecosystem of 12-factor apps, but later also be a place to deploy shared infrastructure.  It's obvious how a platform like this will benefit us operationally, but we'd also like to find ways that it could help reduce the challenges folks face when developing software in a microservice architecture.

### Qualifications
In general, an ideal candidate would have:
+	a desire to use their talents to make the world a better place
+	development experience in any of Ruby, Python, Java, or JavaScript

+	experience with Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt or other automation tools
+	experience with CoreOS, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, or other container orchestration technology
