## Fullstack Engineer
#### Menlo Park, CA

### Quick Summary
We're a well-funded startup building error detection software for construction.
Our team consists of widely published domain experts in 3D computer vision and deep learning. We relish that our jobs allow us to make research contributions to the field of 3D deep learning. We're also maniacally focused on solving real world problems and listen to our customers with rapt attention.

Human error in construction costs the world over $3 trillion per year and is responsible for over 50% of construction projects running over schedule. Our product uses off the shelf sensors and world class perception software to stop that from happening.
