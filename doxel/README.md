# Doxel

## Overview
Doxel is an innovative solution in the Construction industry. Their drone tech can fly through a construction site and catch errors as a building comes to life, before issues go unnoticed and it's too late costing millions!

Human error in construction currently costs the world about $3 Trillion/yr and is largely responsible for over 50% of construction projects running over schedule.

Using 3D computer vision and deep learning, Doxel's software turns off the shelf sensors into error detection tools for construction projects - giving project managers superhuman powers to spot critical issues that they otherwise couldn't.

This significantly reduces costs, and more importantly reduces the risk of a project running over schedule. Since the alpha release in Q3 2016, we've seen a 50x growth in deployments.
