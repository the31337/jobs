### What will I be working on?
As a site reliability engineer, you’re responsible for building and running the platforms that the product is built on top of. You ensure the reliability and security of our production infrastructure. Our philosophy on software engineering includes end-to-end ownership, meaning engineers own their solutions all the way into production. Site reliability is about enabling process and tooling that make it simple, easy and fun for the rest of the engineering to get their code live and as quickly as possible.

### What are you looking for in a team member?
Your specialization is less important than your ability to learn fast and adapt to shifting technologies. We’re especially fond of people who:

+	Focus on project goals, not just writing code.
+	Iterate until customers love what you’ve built, and pay for it.
+	Have a hacker mindset and master the fine art of balancing time, features, and quality of code. You know when to unit test and when to “just ship it”.
+	Strive to grow personally and professionally, beyond just expanding technical abilities.
+	Love to experiment with new technology and share knowledge with the team.
+	Represent the team and product at conferences.

If you are a member of an under-represented group in technology, we strongly encourage you to apply.

As a team, we built multi-million dollar products with this balance in mind.
As a founding team member, you’ll wear multiple hats, embrace ambiguity, and take charge leading complex projects.
