# Company Name
## Overview
RockIT uses it every day and for many of us, life without it is unthinkable.  And as it turns out, we aren't alone in feeling that way.  They have customers and lots of them. Their revenue is trending up and up and are a month or two away from achieving profitability.   Not bad for a 3-year old company of 11 people who raised slightly less than ~3MM in seed capital.  These guys are doing it right.

## Culture
Straight up, the best part of working for Mixmax is the culture.  And I'm not talking about ping pong tables and game nights. I'm talking about the things that really matter to developers.  Theirs is a culture of open-source by default.  They have more public repos (30) than private repos (20). They have an active engineering blog that the entire team invests heavily in contributing to. They release the product multiple times per day. Engineers will ship code within the first couple of days of joining the team. Ownership and autonomy are core values.
