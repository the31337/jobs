## Fullstack engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
77 million Americans work for an hourly wage. Their median income is $34,142. They don’t make a lot of money—and worse, their income and expenses are inconsistent. As a result, they frequently don’t have enough income to cover expenses, so these Americans spend $100 billion every year just to make ends meet. They lose 10-30% of their income to things like payday loans, overdraft fees, and late bill fees. It is expensive to be poor.

You want to fix that. By building software that eliminates the underlying inefficiencies. At our company, you’ll be working on software that gives the lower and middle classes more financial stability, purchasing power, and upward mobility. You’ll be doing it by building products that people love, use every day, and come to depend on. And you’ll be working in an organization that has incredibly high engineering standards, because it treats engineers as product owners.

### You'll:
+	Work up and down our stack: on our apps, our APIs, our servers, our algorithms, our data, our security, everything.
+	Own some aspect of our product. We have no product managers. Instead, we entrust our engineers to be product managers. You’ll be told what we’re trying to achieve. How we achieve it is up to you.
+	Hire other engineers, both by helping us continually improve our evaluation process, and by participating in it.

### To succeed, you'll need:
+	At least a few years working as a full-stack engineer. Given how small our company is, we are currently not hiring new grads or interns.
+	The ability to learn new things quickly.
+	Technology agnosticism. You are not evangelical about technologies or languages. You pragmatically pick the best tool for a given job.
+	A demonstrated fire for building product. You view engineering as one tool among many for building products that add value and help people.
+	The ability to design what you build. You're probably not the best designer in the room, and you enjoy working with others who are stronger at design. But, you understand that design is how it works (not how it looks). Since engineering is also how it works, you think of design as a critical part of engineering—not a thing you do before or after.
