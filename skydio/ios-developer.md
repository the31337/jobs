## iOS Developer
#### Redwood City, CA

### Quick Summary
Truly autonomous drones are a new product category that demand a new kind of mobile experience. Forget complex joysticks and awkward tilt-controls: we are crafting completely novel interactions that leverage our onboard intelligence to empower a much broader, more diverse audience of drone users.

### Job Description
+	You’ll be our first dedicated iOS engineer, building the primary user interface for the world’s most advanced autonomous flying camera.
+	Combine your knowledge of the iOS ecosystem with our Drone Intelligence API and set the gold standard for what a drone app should be.
+	Develop features for controlling the drone’s movement and behaviors (3d camera manipulation, initiation of context-specific cinematic maneuvers, etc.).
+	Improve user experiences by incorporating augmented reality, in-app media interactions and sharing capabilities.
+	Iterate on designs based on user feedback, internal testing and your own product instincts.
+	Establish and guide the quality assurance process for production mobile, including the App Store deployment.

### Qualifications
+	You have passion for meticulously crafted interfaces that strike the correct balance between ease-of-use, elegance and power.
+	You’ve shipped code to the App Store and experienced the joys (and frustrations) of getting feedback from real users.
+	You appreciate the value of code-review and other collaborative development practices.
