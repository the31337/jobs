# Navdy
## Overview
Navdy is a head-up display device that mounts onto the dashboard of any car. Navdy can navigate, tweet, play music, and share GPS coordinates by voice and gesture command without requiring a driver to lift his or her eyes from the road with technology, similar to the devices commercial pilots use to land planes. Navdy has already reached $6M in preorders and has had a similar interest with VCs to a total of about $30M in funding. They were also recognized as one of Fast Company’s most innovative companies.
