## Software Engineer (API)
#### San Mateo, CA

### Quick Summary
We are leading a new type of data security called "active defense." Active defense flips the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. Our company is active defense data protection --- it protects data by continuously moving it around. As we move data, it dynamically mutates, distributes, fragments, and re-encrypts. With any algorithm. In any environment (drones, mobile, Raspberry Pi, cloud, database) and on any combination of data locations, from one to many.

We already have paying customers including the largest and most sophisticated companies and organizations in the world. We are backed by top investors including Draper Associates VC fund, as well as cybersecurity leaders, early investors, and founders from Palo Alto Networks, Palantir, Uber, Facebook, Cyphort, FireEye, Cisco, Juniper, Quora, and others. Our advisors include heads of security and cloud from Google, AWS, Docker, and others.

You would be joining an engineering team that is highly technical and experienced. Our existing engineers have decades of experience on the ground floor of multiple successful security and enterprise startups, with exits, and have worked at companies like Oracle, Cisco, Tenable, Trend Micro, and others. Our engineers have invented distributed programming languages. Built web applications from 0 to millions of users from scratch. Built next-generation military moving target defense technologies.

### Job Description
Our company is a new active defense security startup. We just came out of stealth this month and looking for a full-stack engineer to join our technical team. This is a unique opportunity to join a fast-growing early stage startup with strong traction in the market as one of the first 10 hires. We need hackers who can build rapid prototypes and ship fast, invent new solutions to hard problems, take pride and ownership in their work, and want to work alongside a top-tier technical team.

This position will be building APIs from scratch, building apps on top of those APIs, and doing back-end systems work as well. You are the type of engineer who would have been comfortable as a first 10 engineer at a company like Stripe or Twilio. You are comfortable with multiple cloud environments & container ecosystems. You must be interested in getting your hands dirty and learning new distributed programming languages -- we work in a new language we invented called Hello (if you know C++, you can pick it up in a week). You may also be building integrations into HDFS, SQL databases, and NoSQL databases.
