# Globality

## Overview
Globality is creating a new ecosystem for global trade, enabling small and midsize companies anywhere in the world.

They are making globalization work by connecting small businesses with buyers all over the World. Their platform helps businesses find amazing service providers to take their products/companies to the next level.
(Like HIRED but for services).
Their Service Verticals are:
1) Legal
2) Marketing
3) Environmental Consulting
(soon: HR and Management Consulting)

For Example:
A company in China that invented a digital piano that helps people learn to play and is really successful in China can post their business needs (Marketing Services to enter the U.S.) in the Platform and gets matched with boutique service providers that can help with what they're looking for.
