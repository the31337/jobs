## Head of Support
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are Securing the internet!

Our mission is to improve the security and reliability of the internet. Operations teams currently spend their days fighting fires — critical updates, machine failures, networking outages — instead of moving their infrastructure forward.
Our team wants to enable companies to run their applications securely and reliably in any environment. We hope to dramatically improve the security of “the stack” while making advancements in modern server infrastructure.

### Job Description
We are bringing Kubernetes to the enterprise: making the power of Google-like infrastructure available to every company. As the global leader in cloud infrastructure and container management, our company helps companies run flexible, efficient, and secure infrastructure that powers the digital properties that power their business. With our products and solutions, forward-thinking companies can get products to market quickly, supercharge their IT teams, move fast without compromising security, and get software-defined container tools that just work to run their cloud infrastructure at scale.

We are looking for a hands-on, customer focused executive to build and lead our support organization. You’ll build a team of support engineers to work directly with our customers to help ensure they get maximum value from Tectonic, the enterprise Kubernetes platform, Quay, our container registry, and our Linux. You will be a key part of how our company engages with the market, helping companies adopt and get value from our products. You’ll also work directly with our product, sales, and engineering teams, driving real world feedback into the product roadmap and influencing the direction of our company and our industry.

### Primary responsibilities will include:
+	Building a world class support team that delivers consulting that delights customers, focused on Kubernetes and Linux
+	Managing that team, including process, tools, and taking responsibility for customer outcomes and operating metrics for the group
+	Build for scale: define a standard set of company’s support practices, role definitions, training and knowledge management
+	Working directly with key customers where needed
+	Working with our product teams to bring customer feedback into the product development process

### Relevant skills/experience may include:
+	5+ years of support leadership
+	Working, practical knowledge of cloud infrastructure and/or containers. You need to be able to get your hands dirty with customers and the team as required
+	Comfortable and excited about a building something in a fast-paced, unstructured environment

### Benefits
+	Health, Dental & Vision Coverage
+	Meaningful equity and competitive pay
+	All the artisan coffee you can drink
