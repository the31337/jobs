# RepairPal
## Overview
The engineering team practices the Lean Methodology and pair programming - as much or as little as the engineers can stand it.

Every engineer manages their own releases
RepairPal was founded in 2007 by a group of automobile enthusiasts and entrepreneurs who were frustrated by the expensive and tedious process of fixing and maintaining their vehicles. They created RepairPal to provide drivers with the most accurate, unbiased, and useful car ownership information available. RepairPal is not owned, in whole or in part, by any automobile manufacturer, dealership, auto parts provider, or auto repair facility. RepairPal offers a stress-free, time-saving method of obtaining all the relevant information conscientious consumers need. Unlike any other online resource, RepairPal provides impartial, fair price estimates, the most comprehensive auto shop directory, and expert insights and advice from certified mechanics. RepairPal's unique, patent-pending system relies on multiple sources of difficult-to-acquire proprietary data that has never before been available to consumers. RepairPal also provides a centralized online location where your records can be maintained for the entire ownership cycle of your vehicle. Emails will remind you of an upcoming oil change or scheduled service (coming soon). It's our pleasure to provide all of these features free of charge! We invite you to explore our site and we look forward to your comments and suggestions.
