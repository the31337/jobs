## Team Lead, Full Stack
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We’re changing the world of data connectivity. Our technology unites the marketing technology ecosystem, enabling brands to measure the impact of digital marketing on sales and deliver highly relevant messages to consumers on virtually any channel or device.

As a Team Lead, Full Stack, you’ll be responsible to help engineers develop new skills and advance their careers. You should have a track record of leading productive engineering teams and have at least 1+ years of engineering management experience.

In the first six months of this role, you will start out as an individual contributor, learning our web development technologies, contributing to the development of full stack applications, and forming close working relationship with your teammates in engineering. Once you have a good foundation of the projects here you will take on a new challenge and transition into a management position, leading and coaching a team of full stack software engineers.

On the engineering team we value ownership and individual contribution within a collaborative environment. Be ready to leave your ego at the door, roll up your sleeves and start solving huge challenges as soon as you begin.

### Job Description

+	Experience with mentoring (or managing) people. Previous experience in a team lead role is ideal.
+	Expertise in web development technologies such as Rails, Backbone.js or React or the brains and brawn to become an expert.
