## Product Designer (UI/UX)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We seek to fundamentally change how K-12 classrooms around the world use technology. Education technology is increasingly fragmented across various applications, software, and services. This undermines the utility of technology for educators, leading to cognitive overload, frustration, and ultimately rejection. As a result, technological innovation remains locked out of the classroom.

We’re empowering the next generation of K-12 classrooms, through a classroom system helping teachers integrate all content, curriculum, communication and analytics; think Slack for classrooms. We enable teachers to access the apps/tools they need, through a unified platform tackling a fragmented $69 billion market. Students can view their work, reports and recommendations on their own dashboard.

To tackle this challenge, we seek a User Interface/Experience Designer: someone who can empathize with teachers’ problems and be thoughtful about how students should interact with technology.

### Job Description
+ Our products are information and data heavy; as such one of the designer’s responsibilities will be to design the interface that can reduce this cognitive overload.
+ Collect and organize raw input from teammates, teachers, and administrators, into feature spec, a roadmap, and visual assets to communicate our direction.
+ The ability to see the macro picture of what we’re trying to build in the long term and break down those individual pieces into a cohesive system.
+ Educators can be skeptical of technology in the classroom; they have been over-promised and under-delivered for decades by technology. Your job will be to craft an experience they can trust and feel excited by.
+ You will be working closely with the educator team, running classroom prototypes and occasionally stepping into the classroom to understand user behavior and the problem. Extracting the problem from your contact with educators will be very important for success.
