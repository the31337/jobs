## Lead Mobile iOS
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company seeks to fundamentally change how K-12 classrooms around the world use technology. Education technology is increasingly fragmented across various applications, software, and services. This undermines the utility of technology for educators, leading to cognitive overload, frustration, and ultimately rejection. We are building a classroom system helping teachers integrate all content, curriculum, communication and analytics.

To tackle this challenge, we are seeking an experienced iOS Engineer: someone who will be both an individual contributor and technical lead / mentor. We are building in Swift, and assume candidates will either know, or be willing and able to learn.

### You will:
+ Build new and innovative product features.
+ Maintain high level performance and quality.
+ Collaborate with designers and engineers alike to create an enjoyable user experience.
+ Our engineers to play a role in deciding product strategy.
+ Improve our test automation (unit and functional tests) to improve our overall quality.
+ Push code on your first day on the job with the goal of releasing to the App Store every month.

### What we are looking for:
+ You have built and shipped an iOS product to a large customer base.
+ You have strong Objective-C/Swift programming skills.
+ You are obsessed with writing quality, maintainable code with extensive test coverage.
+ You communicate complex ideas with ease, both in person and in writing.

### Nice to have
+ A passion for education technology
