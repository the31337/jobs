### Why us?
Our company is the leading Conversation Intelligence platform for sales and customer success teams. We believe conversations are the most under-appreciated asset in organizations today, and that having good, effective conversations, and learning from the insights they contain is the biggest lever to growing revenue. We use natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to unite sales conversations into a single dashboard, allowing sales teams to identify what works to close more deals. Using our help is like having a team of sales trainers dedicated to understanding your sales calls, finding the most important moments, and learning exactly what your team could do differently to achieve better outcomes. A typical response to our product demo is: “Holy s—! I didn’t think this was possible.”

Our operations are split across San Francisco, CA and TelAviv, Israel, and our customers include Cisco Meraki, Marketo, Qualtrics, and many more iconic names you’d recognize. We are backed by top tier VC’s including Emergence Capital, who also invested in Salesforce.com, Yammer, SuccessFactors, Box and Veev).
