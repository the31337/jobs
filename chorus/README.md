# Chrous

## Overview
Chorus is an intelligence tool bringing analytics and insights to what once was the black box of sales calls. They received $6.3M from Emergence Capital who funded Salesforce early. Chorus uses natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to unite sales conversations into a single dashboard, allowing sales teams to identify what works to close more deals. The bulk of the R&D team is based in Tel Aviv, but since it is a product with US users, they are building a team in SF. Chorus already has paying customers including Cisco Meraki, Marketo, and Qualtrics who are already reaping the benefits.
