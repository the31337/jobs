# Fullstack Engineer
### San Francisco, CA

## Quick Summary
We invite software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area to join the Innovation Lab to contribute their talent to create new technology interventions to fight child sexual exploitation. The lab's areas of focus will include human trafficking, darkweb child abuse/exploitation content and social platform cyber safety. Technically, projects in these areas will span a wide variety of engineering and analysis topics relevant to cybersecurity and intelligence including adaptive crawling/scraping, statistical analysis, search, machine learning (NLP, computer vision, sentiment analysis), entity resolution, data pipeline development, UI/API design, and more.

Engineers will participate in both product development as well as broad exploration in the space – working to identify new possible interventions. Engineers must be big thinkers, but also executors, interested in solving hard problems that require more than just technical skills – including partnership development and learning new subject matter areas.
