# Robinhood

## Overview
We are built by a tight-knit team of engineers and designers united by the belief that markets should be accessible to everyone. We go out together, order pizza for late-night office grinds, and send cute cat gifs on company-wide group chats. We know when it’s time to work — and when it’s time to play.

We offer competitive compensation packages (salary + equity), health and vision insurance, and liberal vacation policies. Perks include daily catered meals, a fully stocked kitchen, gym memberships, company retreats, and custom workstations.  We’re headquartered in sunny Palo Alto, CA.
