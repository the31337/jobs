# Sysdig
## Overview
In 2013 Loris Degioanni founded Sysdig as he found container technology such an exciting high tech space with massive market needs. Different than the 'container maker', as a container visibility specialist they innovated the industry-first container tool for performance management, trace-driven trouble shooting and application-intelligent monitoring. It is a Simple, Fast and Powerful tool that all the container users would want to use. Series B funding from Accel last year. They just moved to the new office on 100 Bush St, SF.
