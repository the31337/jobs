# 💡 Inkling ✏️

## Overview
Inkling 's Founder Matt is a Harvard Grad, who helped launtch the iPad at Apple.  He founded Inkling in 2009 as he realized the transition from paper to digital would be the trend changing the enterprise space.

Inkling is the industry first content software that has made the digitalization for enterprise companies simple enough for everyone, especially non-tech professionals.

HR, Sales, and Marketing employees can quickly create all the contents on Inkling just like you write things on Google Docs or Microsoft Word - No coding, no InDesign, no PDF, No Powerpoint -- thus enabling enterprise companies to rethink the way they digitize their information.

Inkling just raised 25M Series E funding in Dec 2016, they have a brand new office on Samsome St in SF and here you can see how people are happy working there!
